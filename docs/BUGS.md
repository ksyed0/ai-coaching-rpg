BUG-0001: Heartbeat tests use 30 ms periods and can fail on a loaded CI runner; heartbeatMs of 0 or less is not guarded
Severity: Low
Related Story: US-0009
Related Task: TASK-0009
Status: Open
Fix Branch: bugfix/BUG-0001-heartbeat-test-timing
Lesson Encoded: No
```

A healthy client whose pong is delayed by more than one period is terminated, and a slow join can be killed before `joined`. Use periods of 100-150 ms in the tests. Separately, `heartbeatMs: 0`, a negative value or NaN makes `setInterval(0)` terminate sockets almost at once; production never passes the option, but it should be validated.

BUG-0002: Connection failures on a custom Anthropic endpoint are reported as "redirects are refused"
Severity: Low
Related Story: US-0014
Related Task: TASK-0014
Status: Open
Fix Branch: bugfix/BUG-0002-anthropic-endpoint-errors
Lesson Encoded: No
```

With `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` set, the redirect-refusing fetch wrapper maps every non-abort failure (ECONNREFUSED, DNS errors, redirects) to one generic message, which hides the real cause. Distinguish a refused redirect from other connection errors while still never echoing URLs or keys.
